Manyavar’s growth as a brand is also heavily attributed to its extensive focus on marketing and advertising that boasts of the highest advertising budget in the industry. While it started out as a wedding- wear brand, over time there has been a paradigm shift from wedding to celebrations on the whole and the new campaigns’ focus on branding the label as Celebration wear.
